Not a ton of coding. More of environment setup ...

1) Completed GitHub Hello World:
https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/
https://github.com/calvertgames/hello-world

2) Setup Eclipse 4.18.0.20201210-1200

3) Created a Hello World example and configurd Ecliipse to use GitHub (not intuitive):
-Version Control (Team) --> Git --> Configuration
-Add Entry email : value
-Add Entry name : value

Found some useful links to help with GitHub configuration:

4) Deleted forked 100DaysOfCode repo and created a new one, to allow for my own orginization/layout ... a couple of times.
Eclipse - Teams - GitHub integration mmay not be correct; or user error.
